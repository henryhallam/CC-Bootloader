CC Bootloader
=============

CC Bootloader is a simple USB bootloader for the CC1111 microcontroller (and
probably others in the family e.g. CC2511). It allows the update of the 
microcontroller firmware over its USB port. It also supports reading and
writing to the flash memory of the microcontroller e.g. for user data storage.

The bootloader consists of two components, a piece of firmware that is flashed
onto the device and a python utility for downloading code and manipulating the
flash memory.

Usage
-----

The first step is to flash your device with the `CCBootloader.hex` firmware
file. Once the device is flashed with this firmware it will identify itself
over USB as a CDC-class device which means it should show up as a serial port
without requiring any drivers on Linux and Mac OS X. Windows users should use
the `CCBootloader.inf` driver file in the `driver` subdirectory.

If you have downloaded a release version of CC Bootloader it will include a
`CCBootloader.hex` file that you can simply flash onto your device. If you
have downloaded a development version then see the Building section below to
build the `CCBootloader.hex` file. You may also want to build your own version
to enable or disable certain features.

You can now use the bootloader.py python script to download your payload code.
This script requires the [pySerial](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/) library.
If you have `easy_install` then installing pySerial should be simple:

`sudo easy_install pyserial`

For usage instructions of this script, run the script with no arguments:

`./bootloader.py`

Preparing your user code for usage with the bootloader is very simple. All you
need to do is set your linker to start the code section at a higher location
in memory specified by the `USER_CODE_BASE` define in `src/main.h`. For an
example of this see the `Makefile` file in the `example_payload` subdirectory.
This is the relevant line:

`LDFLAGS_FLASH = ... --code-loc 0x1400 ...`

Known issues
------------
Interrupts in the user application:
The CPU vectors to the interrupt table at 0x0003 in the bootloader code.  Here
we just jump to the appropriate entry in a "shadow" interrupt vector table in
the user application.  This introduces a very small additional latency
(couple CPU cycles).

USB interrupts are currently not supported in the user application.  If you want
to use USB in the user app, look at start.asm and figure out a way to forward
the interrupt call to the user ISR only when the bootloader is not running.


Building
--------

This requires [sdcc](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) (Small Device C Compiler).
Then it should be as simple as issuing

`make`

from the root directory of the project.

Build Options
-------------

The only option that can currently be enabled or disabled is whether to start
running the user payload code after a certain timeout with no command issued 
over USB. Once a USB command is issued this timeout will be canceled and a
command must be issued to explicitly start the user code. This option is 
specified in `src/main.h`. Just comment or uncomment this line:

`#define TIMER`

You may also change the length of the timeout (default 10 seconds):

`#define TIMER_TIMEOUT 229 // 10s timeout`

Please note that if you make changes to the bootloader you may need to adjust
the value of `USER_CODE_BASE`. You will need to do this if the linker
complains that it has run out of space. This value muse be a multiple of 1,024
so that the user code begins on a page boundary.

You must reflect this change in several places:

1. Change the value of `USER_CODE_BASE` in `src/main.h`

2. Change the value of `--code-size` in `Makefile`

3. Change all the lines similar to `ljmp #(0x1400+0x03)` in `src/start.asm`.
	 The constant `0x1400` should be changed to match `USER_CODE_BASE` but the
	 `+0x??` part should be unchanged.

Hopefully step three will not be needed in the future when I find a better
way to implement this part of the code.

If you want the bootloader to only be invoked under certain conditions, e.g.
the presence of USB power then please modify the `want_bootloader` function
in `main.c`

All the board specific code is in `hal.c` so make sure to take a look at that
if you are porting the code to a new board.
